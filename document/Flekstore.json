Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re coming soon.\r\n\r\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia &mdash; it&#39;s available on your daily driver.\r\n",

But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended.\n",

It sounds complicated, but our application takes all the work for itself. This effect is also known as the Hitchcock effect, which first applied it when shooting his film “Vertigo”.\r&nbsp; &nbsp;FEATURES\r• Select an effect mode - zoom in or zoom out. Try both options.\r• Set the time for movie shooting. The shorter the time, the faster you need to move the camera toward or away from the subject.\r• Change the strength of the effect - the original zoom. The distance to the subject during movie shooting.\r• Shoot vertically or horizontally.\r• Share videos or save them in your Camera Roll to share them later.\r• Simple design allows you to instantly start shooting and does not interfere with your creativity.\rDownload the app and start create videos!
